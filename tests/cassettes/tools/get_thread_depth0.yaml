        are looking for a wider audience than those who already know the context of
        dropbox, make a video where you lay out the case for use of dropbox using
        simple examples from user point of view(think a college student) and then
        in the demo show just the basic features. I got the feeling you tried to show
        too many features too quickly.<p>In general, I have realized it is much better
        to launch with something that does a few things REALLY well rather than a
        lot of things with little focus. When you launch with whole lot of features
        people assume you are competing with the big companies. When you launch small
        and do it well, it is easier to attract a user-base and THEN keep feeding

        on being able to specify a folder inside the dropbox as a \"server\" folder,
        which means it has it''s own ftp address, user, and password settings.  Anything
        dragged there is automatically synched with that account.  I thought of this
        as well as soon as I read that post about Linux support, as this would work
        with shared hosting without expecting hosts to install dropbox on their linux
        boxes.  And the data would be backed up as well automatically in a third place
        (the drop box.)  And, you''d have access to retrieve an older version of a
        file.  This basically replaces the need for FTP clients if you also add a
        way to chmod the folders inside the \"server\" folder.  Sam is 100% right.","title":null,"type":"comment","url":null}],"created_at":"2007-04-05T06:09:46.000Z","created_at_i":1175753386,"id":9081,"options":[],"parent_id":8892,"points":null,"story_id":8863,"text":"Hey

        think user experience can and will be duplicated. I did post a link to an
        SVN front-end that has a very similar interface. Maybe the competitors are
        locked-in to some bad design decisions and can''t quite recreate the same
        user experience... but that''s a little optimistic.<p>Anyway you slice it,
        you need to have a profit margin. And with a commodity like storage (and the
        soon-to-be commodity of online storage), you have to be competitve with market
        prices. The reason that most YC startups can worry about user adoption is
        because they aren''t tied down to this problem. They aren''t really making
        commodities and the cost of makign the product isn''t so suffocating.<p>That''s
        why Dropbox needs to plan for moving off S3. There is so much innovation in
        storage backends... so much research to read. Think of Google Filesystem.
        It makes storage very very very cheap.<p>Here''s a good plan for Dropbox.
        Use S3 as a secondary solution. The primary storage should be local to them
        (servers running a filesystem that takes advantage of unique properties of
        the workload... like Google does). When it fills up, traffic thereafter is
        handled by S3 instead. Then, they can relax in worrying about and scaling
        local storage. They can take their time buying more hardware, and rolling
        out software changes to the storage system. They can migrate the data from
        S3 to local storage at will. And now, their customers can be charged a flexible
        price, because they control their own expenses. In other words, think of S3
        as \"datacenter outsourcing\".<p>But this might be too long-term... it might
        be something to worry about post-YC.<p>But I think it might be easy to build
        a storage implementation that runs local and exposes the same exact interface
        as S3. And, poof, we just abstract the whole backend away, and just flip a
        switch when we want to go one way or the other. And it reduces latency. Then
        you go after zero-downtime data migration from S3 to your local systems...
        which can be done I think... and I think you would be happy.","title":null,"type":"comment","url":null}],"created_at":"2007-04-05T08:15:44.000Z","created_at_i":1175760944,"id":9124,"options":[],"parent_id":9001,"points":null,"story_id":8863,"text":"I

        to resell S3 at a premium for the added value of these nice Coda-like features.
        Would you pay a premium for these Dropbox features? Maybe, I don''t know.<p>Also,

        re: the first part, many people want something plug and play. and even if
        they were plug and play, the problem is that the user experience (on windows
        at least) with online drives generally sucks, and you don''t have disconnected
        access.<p>windows for sure doesn''t hide latency well (CIFS is bad, webdav
        etc. are worse), and most apps are written as if the disk was local, and assume,
        for example, accessing a file only takes a few ms. if the server is 80ms away,
        and you do 100 accesses (e.g. the open file common dialog listing a directory
        and poking files for various attributes or icons) serially, suddenly your
        UI locks up for _seconds_ (joel spolsky summarizes this well in his article
        on leaky abstractions.) ditto saving any file; you change one character in
        your 20mb word file and hit save, and your upstream-capped 40k/sec comcast
        connection is hosed for 8 minutes. sure for docs of a few hundred k it''s
        fine, but doing work on large docs on an online drive feels like walking around
        with cinder blocks tied to your feet. anyway, the point of that rant was that
        dropbox uses a _local_ folder with efficient sync in the background, which
        is an important difference :)<p>2. true, if you''re both not at your computer
        and on another computer without net access, this won''t replace a usb drive
        :) but the case i''m worried about is being, for example, on a plane, and
        dropbox will let you get to the most recent version of your docs at the time
        you were last connected, and will sync everything up when you get back online
        (without you having to copy anything or really do anything.)<p>3. there are
        some unannounced viral parts i didn''t get to show in there :) it''ll be a

        have a few qualms with this app:<p>1. For a Linux user, you can already build
        such a system yourself quite trivially by getting an FTP account, mounting
        it locally with curlftpfs, and then using SVN or CVS on the mounted filesystem.  From
        Windows or Mac, this FTP account could be accessed through built-in software.<p>2.
        It doesn''t actually replace a USB drive.  Most people I know e-mail files
        to themselves or host them somewhere online to be able to perform presentations,
        but they still carry a USB drive in case there are connectivity problems.  This
        does not solve the connectivity issue.<p>3. It does not seem very \"viral\"
        or income-generating.  I know this is premature at this point, but without
        charging users for the service, is it reasonable to expect to make money off
        of this?","title":null,"type":"comment","url":null},{"author":"bls","children":[],"created_at":"2007-04-06T19:05:29.000Z","created_at_i":1175886329,"id":9671,"options":[],"parent_id":8863,"points":null,"story_id":8863,"text":"This
        is an interesting application. But, your demo video does not do it justice:
        (a) It is too long; (b) your folders that you use in the video have too many
        files in them; you say about 10x more words than necessary; and (d) your voice,
        combined with the bad microphone input, make the explanation sounds pad.<p>Your
        main competition is not USB drives: it is HotMail, GMail, and Yahoo! Mail.
        Once people are taught the \"email it to yourself\" trick, they love to use
        it--I think because it is not so intuitive for people, yet it is so simple,
        that they are proud that they are doing something so clever.\n","title":null,"type":"comment","url":null},{"author":"danw","children":[],"created_at":"2007-04-08T10:32:05.000Z","created_at_i":1176028325,"id":10403,"options":[],"parent_id":8863,"points":null,"story_id":8863,"text":"Looks
