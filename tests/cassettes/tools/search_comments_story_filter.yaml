        re: the first part, many people want something plug and play. and even if

        access.<p>windows for sure doesn''t hide latency well (CIFS is bad, webdav
        etc. are worse), and most apps are written as if the disk was local, and assume,

        and you do 100 accesses (e.g. the open file common dialog listing a directory
        and poking files for various attributes or icons) serially, suddenly your
        UI locks up for _seconds_ (joel spolsky summarizes this well in his article

        your 20mb word file and hit save, and your upstream-capped 40k/sec comcast
        connection is hosed for 8 minutes. sure for docs of a few hundred k it''s
        fine, but doing work on large docs on an online drive feels like walking around
        with cinder blocks tied to your feet. anyway, the point of that rant was that
