        everyone, I\u2019m FCC Commissioner Nathan Simington, and I\u2019m here to
        discuss security updates for IoT devices and how you can make a difference
        by filing comments with the FCC.<p>As you know, serious vulnerabilities are
        common in IoT, and it often takes too long for these to be patched on end-user
        devices\u2014if the manufacturer even bothers to release an update, and if
        the device was even designed to receive them. Companies may stop supporting
        a device well before consumers have stopped using it. The support period is
        often not communicated at the time of sale. And sometimes the end of support
        is not even announced, leaving even informed users unsure whether their devices
        are still safe.<p>I\u2019ve advocated for the FCC to require device manufacturers
        to support their devices with security updates for a reasonable amount of
        time [1]. I can''t bring such a proposal to a vote since I\u2019m not the
        chairman of the agency. But I was able to convince my colleagues to tentatively
        support something a little more moderate addressing this problem.<p>The FCC
        recently issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [2] for a cybersecurity labeling
        program for connected devices. If they meet certain criteria for the security
        of their product, manufacturers can put an FCC cybersecurity label on it.
        I fought hard for one of these criteria to be the disclosure of how long the
        product will receive security updates. I hope that, besides arming consumers
        with better information, the commitments on this label (including the support
        period) will be legally enforceable in contract and tort lawsuits and under
        other laws. You can see my full statement here [3].<p>But it\u2019s too early
        to declare victory. Many manufacturers oppose making any commitments about
        security updates, even voluntary ones. These manufacturers are heavily engaged
        at the FCC and represented by sophisticated regulatory lawyers. The FCC and
        White House are not likely to take a strong stand if they only hear the device
        manufacturer''s side of the story.<p>In short, they need to hear from you.
        You have experienced insecure protocols, exposed private keys, and other atrocious
        security. You have seen these problems persist despite ample warning. People
        ask, \u2018why aren\u2019t there rules about these things?\u2019 This is your
        chance to get on the record and tell us what you think the rules should be.
        If infosec doesn\u2019t make this an issue, the general public will continue
        falsely assuming that everything is fine. But if you get on the record and
        the government fails to act, the evidence of this failure will be all over
        the Internet forever.<p>If you want to influence the process, you have until
        September 25th, 2023 (midnight ET) to file comments in the rulemaking proceeding.[4]

        and click to file either an \u2018express\u2019 comment (type into a textbox)
        or a \u2018standard\u2019 comment (upload a PDF). Either way, the FCC is required
        to consider your arguments. All options are on the table, so don\u2019t hold
        back, but do make your arguments as clear as possible, so even lawyers can
        understand them. If you have a qualification (line of work, special degree,
        years of experience, etc.) that would bolster the credibility of your official
        comment, be sure to mention that, but the only necessary qualification is
        being an interested member of the public.<p>I\u2019m here to listen and learn.
        AMA. Feel free to ask any questions about this or related issues, and I\u2019ll
        answer as many as I can. I just ask that we try to stay on the topic of security.
        My legal advisor, Marco Peraza, a security-focused software engineer turned
        cybersecurity lawyer, will be answering questions too.   \nI\u2019m open to
        incorporating your ideas (and even being convinced I\u2019m wrong), and I
        hope that my colleagues at the FCC are as well. Thank you!<p>Edit: The Q&amp;A
        is over now, but please keep this great discussion going without us. Thanks
        again everyone for your input. Don''t forget to file comments if you want

        a 24 y&#x2F;o full stack engineer (I know some of you are rolling your eyes
        right now, just highlighting that I have experience on frontend apps as well
        as backend architecture). I&#x27;ve been working professionally for ~7 years
        building mostly javascript projects but also some PHP. Two years ago I was
        diagnosed with a condition called &quot;Usher&#x27;s Syndrome&quot; - characterized
        by hearing loss, balance issues, and progressive vision loss.<p>I know there
        are blind software engineers out there. My main questions are:<p>- Are there
        blind frontend engineers?<p>- What kinds of software engineering lend themselves
        to someone with limited vision? Backend only?<p>- Besides a screen reader,
        what are some of the best tools for building software with limited vision?<p>-
        Does your company employ blind engineers? How well does it work? What kind
        of engineer are they?<p>I&#x27;m really trying to get ahead of this thing
        and prepare myself as my vision is degrading rather quickly. I&#x27;m not
        sure what I can do if I can&#x27;t do SE as I don&#x27;t have any formal education
        in anything. I&#x27;ve worked really hard to get to where I am and don&#x27;t
        want it to go to waste.<p>Thank you for any input, and stay safe out there!<p>Edit:<p>Thank
        you all for your links, suggestions, and moral support, I really appreciate
        it. Since my diagnosis I&#x27;ve slowly developed a crippling anxiety centered
        around a feeling that I need to figure out the rest of my life before it&#x27;s
        too late. I know I shouldn&#x27;t think this way but it is hard not to. I&#x27;m
        very independent and I feel a pressure to &quot;show up.&quot; I will look
        into these opportunities mentioned and try to get in touch with some more
        members of the blind engineering community.","title":"Ask HN: I''m a software
