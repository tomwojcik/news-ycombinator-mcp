        are correct that this presents a very good, easy-to-install piece of functionality

        part about efficient background sync is a good point, too.  I have noticed
        some minor lagging using curlftpfs in Linux, and that might be something that

        re: the first part, many people want something plug and play. and even if
        they were plug and play, the problem is that the user experience (on windows
        at least) with online drives generally sucks, and you don''t have disconnected
        access.<p>windows for sure doesn''t hide latency well (CIFS is bad, webdav
        etc. are worse), and most apps are written as if the disk was local, and assume,
        for example, accessing a file only takes a few ms. if the server is 80ms away,
        and you do 100 accesses (e.g. the open file common dialog listing a directory
        and poking files for various attributes or icons) serially, suddenly your
        UI locks up for _seconds_ (joel spolsky summarizes this well in his article
        on leaky abstractions.) ditto saving any file; you change one character in
        your 20mb word file and hit save, and your upstream-capped 40k/sec comcast
        connection is hosed for 8 minutes. sure for docs of a few hundred k it''s
        fine, but doing work on large docs on an online drive feels like walking around
        with cinder blocks tied to your feet. anyway, the point of that rant was that
        dropbox uses a _local_ folder with efficient sync in the background, which
        is an important difference :)<p>2. true, if you''re both not at your computer
        and on another computer without net access, this won''t replace a usb drive
        :) but the case i''m worried about is being, for example, on a plane, and
        dropbox will let you get to the most recent version of your docs at the time
        you were last connected, and will sync everything up when you get back online
        (without you having to copy anything or really do anything.)<p>3. there are
        some unannounced viral parts i didn''t get to show in there :) it''ll be a
        freemium model. up to x gb free, tiered plans above that.","title":null,"type":"comment","url":null}],"created_at":"2007-04-05T15:16:54.000Z","created_at_i":1175786214,"id":9224,"options":[],"parent_id":8863,"points":null,"story_id":8863,"text":"I
        have a few qualms with this app:<p>1. For a Linux user, you can already build
        such a system yourself quite trivially by getting an FTP account, mounting
        it locally with curlftpfs, and then using SVN or CVS on the mounted filesystem.  From
        Windows or Mac, this FTP account could be accessed through built-in software.<p>2.
        It doesn''t actually replace a USB drive.  Most people I know e-mail files
        to themselves or host them somewhere online to be able to perform presentations,
        but they still carry a USB drive in case there are connectivity problems.  This
        does not solve the connectivity issue.<p>3. It does not seem very \"viral\"
        or income-generating.  I know this is premature at this point, but without
        charging users for the service, is it reasonable to expect to make money off
        of this?","title":null,"type":"comment","url":null}
